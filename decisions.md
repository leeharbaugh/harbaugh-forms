## Visual PDF Field Editor

**Date:** 2026-06-10

**Decision:**  
Use a visual PDF field editor rather than AI-generated coordinate suggestions.

**Reason:**  
Coordinate mappings may become unreliable when TREC or TXR revises a form. A visual editor provides a more reviewable and maintainable workflow.

**Consequences:**

- Users place fields visually.
- Coordinates are stored behind the scenes.
- Existing form_field_mappings remains but is simplified.
- Business-field definitions are separated from PDF placement.

## Soft Deletes

**Decision:**  
Use soft deletes throughout the application.

**Reason:**  
Real estate records, templates, and generated transactions should remain recoverable and auditable.

**Consequences:**

- Tables should have status or active fields.
- Normal deletion actions should mark records inactive.
- Queries should normally exclude inactive records.
