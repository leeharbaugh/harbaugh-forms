# Harbaugh Forms — Architectural Decisions

## Decision Format

Each decision should include:

- Date
- Decision
- Reason
- Consequences
- Related files or migrations

## Visual PDF Field Editor

**Date:** 2026-06-10

**Decision:**  
Use a visual PDF field editor rather than AI-generated coordinate suggestions.

**Reason:**  
Coordinate mappings may become unreliable when TREC or TXR revises a form. A visual editor provides a more reviewable and maintainable workflow.

**Consequences:**

- Users place fields visually.
- Coordinates are stored behind the scenes.
- Existing form_field_mappings remains but is simplified.
- Business-field definitions are separated from PDF placement.

---

## Soft Deletes

**Date:** 2026-06-02

**Decision:**  
Use soft deletes throughout the application.

**Reason:**  
Real estate records, templates, and generated transactions should remain recoverable and auditable.

**Consequences:**

- Tables should have status or active fields.
- Normal deletion actions should mark records inactive.
- Queries should normally exclude inactive records.

---

## Form and Collection Scope

**Date:** 2026-07-15

**Decision:**
Forms may be either `GLOBAL` or `PRIVATE`. Collections may be either `ORGANIZATION` or `PRIVATE`. Collections must not be created as `GLOBAL`.

**Reason:**
Texas promulgated forms are shared statewide by agents and brokers, so individual form templates can appropriately be Global. Collections represent brokerage-specific packet workflows, preferences, and operating practices, so they should be shared only within an organization or kept private to an individual user.

**Consequences:**

* Global forms are available statewide to authenticated users.
* Organization collections are available only to active members of the assigned organization.
* Active organization members may view, use, and copy organization collections into their private collections.
* Normal organization members may not edit the organization source.
* `ORG_ADMIN` members may manage collections for their own organization.
* Application administrators may manage organization collections across organizations.
* New Global collection creation is blocked.
* Existing organization and private collections remain independently editable.
* Copying an organization collection creates a separate private collection and does not modify the organization source.

**Related files or migrations:**

* `supabase/migrations/20260715120000_organization_collections_and_property_uniqueness.sql`
* Collection permission helpers
* Collection list and detail UI
* Collection cloning functions
* Packet creation from collections

## Form Default Scope

**Date:** 2026-07-15

**Decision:**
Form default values may be scoped only as `PRIVATE` or `ORGANIZATION`. Default values must never be `GLOBAL`.

**Reason:**
Default values represent an individual agent’s preferences or a brokerage’s operating practices. They may contain compensation preferences, protection periods, intermediary selections, preferred addenda, brokerage information, recurring checkbox selections, or office-specific wording. These values should not be published statewide merely because the underlying form is Global.

**Consequences:**

* Private defaults belong to one user.
* Organization defaults belong to one brokerage or organization.
* A user’s Private default overrides the Organization default for the same field.
* Organization defaults apply only to users with an active membership in the organization.
* Default resolution uses the packet owner or intended business user, not whichever administrator is viewing the record.
* Global forms and fields may retain structural metadata such as:

  * field keys
  * labels
  * widget types
  * source paths
  * coordinates
  * AcroForm names
  * checkbox export values
  * formatting instructions
* Global catalog fields contain no user-preference defaults. Private and Organization defaults are stored only in scoped `field_defaults`. Global catalog `default_value`, `default_checked`, and `fallback_value` may be retained only when deliberately classified as structural constants.
* Personal or brokerage-specific literal values must not be stored on Global forms, fields, or mappings.
* Explicit packet values and authoritative transaction data take precedence over defaults.
* A dedicated `field_defaults` table stores scoped preference values.
* Full user-facing management of My Defaults and Organization Defaults may be implemented separately.

**Related files or migrations:**

* `supabase/migrations/20260715180000_field_defaults_scoped.sql`
* `supabase/migrations/20260717120000_clear_global_money_zero_defaults.sql`

* `lib/types/field-default.ts`
* `lib/field-defaults.ts`
* Field-default resolution logic
* Packet field-resolution logic

---

## Default-Value Resolution Precedence

**Date:** 2026-07-15

**Decision:**
Field values should be resolved using a deterministic precedence order that favors explicit transaction data over stored defaults.

**Reason:**
A stored preference should help prepopulate a form, but it should never override a value that was explicitly entered for the current transaction or resolved from the selected client, property, agent, brokerage, or packet.

**Consequences:**

The preferred resolution order is:

1. Explicit packet-specific override
2. Mapped transaction or business source data
3. Private user default
4. Organization default
5. Structural fallback or universal mapping constant
6. Blank, false, or `NA`, according to the field’s established behavior

Additional rules:

* Private defaults override Organization defaults.
* Deleted or inactive defaults are ignored.
* Organization defaults require an active organization and active membership.
* The user’s `primary_organization_id` determines which Organization defaults apply.
* The application must not choose an arbitrary organization when a user belongs to multiple organizations.
* An administrator viewing another user’s packet must not cause the administrator’s own defaults to be applied.

**Related files or migrations:**

* `lib/field-defaults.ts`
* Packet field-resolution logic
* `public.field_defaults`
* User profile and primary-organization resolution

## Copy Private Form to Global Library

**Date:** 2026-07-15

**Decision:**
Copying a private form into the Global library creates a separate and independent Global form. The operation must not convert, reassign, or otherwise modify the source private form.

**Reason:**
A user may have invested substantial work in a private PDF template, field placements, mappings, and preferences. Making a form available statewide should not remove or alter the user’s original version.

**Consequences:**

* The source form remains `PRIVATE`.
* The source owner remains unchanged.
* The source PDF remains in its original Storage location.
* The source fields, mappings, and scoped defaults remain unchanged.
* The Global copy receives:

  * a new form ID
  * a new Global Storage path
  * copied structural mappings
  * new mapping IDs
  * appropriate Global field references
  * traceability metadata
* The Global copy does not receive:

  * Private defaults
  * Organization defaults
  * packet-specific values
  * agent-specific literals
  * brokerage-specific literals
  * collections
  * packets
  * generated PDFs
* Existing safe Global catalog fields may be reused.
* Safe structural Private fields may be converted into new Global field definitions.
* User-specific or brokerage-specific Private fields must be blocked or reviewed before publication.
* The source and Global copy do not synchronize after creation.
* Editing, deleting, replacing, or deactivating one version does not affect the other.
* The user-facing action is named `Copy to Global Library`, not Promote.
* Only active application administrators may perform the operation.
* `ORG_ADMIN` status alone does not grant this authority.

**Related files or migrations:**

* `supabase/migrations/20260715140000_form_copy_to_global_traceability.sql`
* `lib/admin/copy-form-to-global.ts`
* `lib/admin/global-form-identity.ts`
* `lib/form-owner-display.ts`
* Forms list and form-detail UI

## Private Form Ownership Presentation

**Date:** 2026-07-15

**Decision:**
When an application administrator views a private form owned by another user, the interface must display the owner’s identity rather than describing the form as the administrator’s form.

**Reason:**
Labels such as `Mine` or an unqualified `Private` label can incorrectly imply ownership and make administrative actions confusing or unsafe.

**Consequences:**

* A Global form is labeled `Global`.
* A user’s own private form is labeled `Private`.
* An administrator viewing another user’s private form sees:

  * `Owned by [User Name]`, or
  * `Private` together with `Owner: [User Name]`
* Owner resolution should prefer a readable profile name and fall back to an appropriate email.
* Raw user UUIDs must not be displayed.
* Standard users do not see other users’ private forms or ownership information.
* Copy to Global Library confirmation text must state that the original owner’s private form will remain unchanged.

**Related files or migrations:**

* `lib/form-owner-display.ts`
* `components/forms/forms-page.tsx`
* Form detail and editor metadata
* Library permission helpers

## Global Form Copy Traceability

**Date:** 2026-07-15

**Decision:**
A Global form copied from a private source should retain lightweight traceability identifying the source form, source owner, copying administrator, and copy date.

**Reason:**
Administrators need to understand where a Global form originated without creating lifecycle dependence between the source and the copy.

**Consequences:**

* The Global form records:

  * `copied_from_form_id`
  * `copied_from_owner_user_id`
  * `copied_by_user_id`
  * `copied_to_global_at`
* Traceability is informational only.
* The source form is not modified when a copy is created.
* Deleting or deactivating the source does not affect the Global copy.
* Deleting the Global copy does not affect the source.
* Foreign-key behavior must not cascade deletion between the records.
* This traceability does not replace a future full audit system.

**Related files or migrations:**

* `supabase/migrations/20260715140000_form_copy_to_global_traceability.sql`
* `forms` table
* Copy-to-Global server action

---

## Property Address Uniqueness

**Date:** 2026-07-15

**Decision:**
A user may have only one non-deleted property record for the same normalized physical address.

**Reason:**
Literal address comparisons allowed duplicate records when the same property was entered using variations such as `Court` and `Ct.`, different capitalization, spacing, state formats, or ZIP+4.

**Consequences:**

* Property uniqueness is scoped by `owner_user_id`.
* Different users may independently store the same property address.
* The uniqueness key includes normalized:

  * street address
  * unit or suite
  * city
  * state
  * ZIP5
* Normalization includes:

  * trimming
  * case normalization
  * repeated-space removal
  * supported punctuation handling
  * deterministic street-suffix normalization
  * `Texas` and `TX` equivalence
  * ZIP and ZIP+4 equivalence
  * blank and null unit equivalence
* `ACTIVE` and `INACTIVE` records block another non-deleted duplicate.
* `DELETED` records do not prevent creation of a replacement property.
* Restoring a deleted property is rejected when a conflicting non-deleted property exists.
* Editing an address to match another property owned by the same user is rejected.
* Application validation provides a clear message, but the database unique index remains authoritative.
* No property belonging to another user is exposed when reporting a duplicate.

**Related files or migrations:**

* `supabase/migrations/20260715120000_organization_collections_and_property_uniqueness.sql`
* Property normalization helpers
* Property create, edit, and restore actions
* `properties_owner_address_live_uidx`
* Property-address tests

## Organization Collection Permissions

**Date:** 2026-07-15

**Decision:**
Organization collection permissions are based on active organization membership and role.

**Reason:**
Brokerage packet workflows should be available to brokerage members while remaining protected from unrelated users and organizations.

**Consequences:**

### Active member

May:

* view organization collections
* view their ordered forms
* create packets directly from them
* copy them into private collections

May not:

* edit the organization source
* add, remove, or reorder forms
* delete, restore, or change status
* reassign the collection to another organization

### ORG_ADMIN

May:

* create organization collections for their own organization
* edit organization collections for their own organization
* add, remove, and reorder forms
* perform permitted lifecycle actions
* copy organization collections privately

May not:

* manage another organization’s collections

### Application ADMIN

May:

* manage organization collections across organizations
* assign an organization where permitted
* perform administrative lifecycle actions

### Outsider

May not:

* view
* copy
* use for packet creation
* mutate
* access collection forms through the collection

RLS remains authoritative for all collection permissions.

* Collection RLS policies
* Collection permission helpers
